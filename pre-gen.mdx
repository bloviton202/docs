## Edit Cutout

Refine your product image before background generation.

**What it does:**

The **Edit Cutout** tool allows you to:

- **Erase** unwanted elements from the uploaded image  
- **Restore** parts of the image that may have been removed during automatic background removal  

**Use cases:**

- Clean up backgrounds (e.g., remove price tags or hands)  
- Restore product edges that were accidentally cut  
- Ensure the cutout is clean and accurate before proceeding

These edits directly affect the silhouette and appearance of your product in every scene.

## Multi-Product

Generate packshots that include more than one product.

**What it does:**

With **Multi-Product**, you can upload several product images to include them in the same packshot.

**Use cases:**

- Create product bundles or group shots  
- Showcase complementary items together (e.g., chair + table)  
- Maintain consistent scale and alignment before scene generation

Once added, all products are part of the same cutout and will be composed together when generating a background.

## Accessorize Before Generation

Add accessories *on top of or around* your product before generating a background.

Any accessories added during this step become a permanent part of your packshot once saved.

### How it works:

1. Use the **brush tool** to define the accessory’s boundaries  
   - The size of your brush indicates the intended size of the object  
   - **Pro tip:** Brush slightly *larger* than the actual accessory for best results

2. Provide a **detailed description** of the accessory  
   - The more specific, the better — especially for complex items like animals or people  
   - Examples:
     - ✅ “Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in a blue wool blanket”
     - ❌ “Brown dog”

3. Build up your accessories **gradually**  
   - Add one, click “Save changes,” then add another if needed  
   - Once saved, these accessories become part of the *final* product cutout and cannot be edited later
