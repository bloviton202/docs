## Silo Quality Requirements

Perfect product shots are the foundation of stunning AI-generated scenes. Follow these guidelines for optimal results.

> **Key Principle:** The quality of your input directly affects your output. Invest in good product photography.

---

## File Requirements

### Accepted Formats

- `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- All common image types supported
- **Transparency**: PNG with alpha channel works perfectly
- **File size**: Up to 50MB per image

### Resolution Guidelines

> **Always provide the highest-resolution photos available.** AI can’t add detail that isn’t there.

| **Minimum**      | **Recommended**   | **Optimal**       |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1000×1000 px     | 2000×2000 px      | 4000×4000 px+     |
| Web-only use     | Standard quality  | Print & zoom      |

## Background Options

### White Background (Silo)

- **Advantages**: Clean, consistent, professional  
- **Best for**: E-commerce, catalogs, batch processing  
- **Tips**: Ensure true white (#FFFFFF), not gray

### Lifestyle Shots

- **Advantages**: Can extract product with context  
- **Process**: AI automatically removes background  
- **Use when**: Silo shots unavailable

> Background removal is automatic for both types – no manual masking needed!

## 3D Rendering Guidelines

### Export Settings

When using 3D software, optimize your exports:

- High resolution
- Proper lighting and textures

| Quality          | Resolution         |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Minimum**      | 2K (2048×2048 px)  |
| **Recommended**  | 4K (4096×4096 px)  |
| **Maximum**      | 8K if available    |

## Critical Canvas Placement Rules

### The Permanent Position Principle

> **CRITICAL:** Where you place the product on canvas is its **FINAL** position. This cannot be changed after generation.

#### Placement Steps

1. **Upload Product** – Import your silo or lifestyle shot  
2. **Position Carefully** – Place product where it should appear in final scene  
3. **Scale Appropriately** – Size tells AI about floor level and perspective  
4. **Leave Space** – Empty canvas space = room for AI to build scene

### Common Positioning Mistakes

| **Mistake**            | **Result**              | **Solution**                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Product fills canvas   | No room for scene       | Scale down, reposition        |
| Floating placement     | Unrealistic scenes      | Lower to establish floor      |
| Edge placement         | Cropped results         | Center with margin            |
| Wrong scale            | Proportion issues       | Reference real-world size     |

## Pre-Generation Workflow

### Accessorizing Before Generation

> **Rule:** Add ALL accessories **before** clicking “Generate background”

1. Position main product  
2. Select Accessorize tool  
3. Brush areas for each accessory  
4. Describe specifically what should appear  
5. Then generate complete scene

### Brush Tool Technique

#### Size Guidance

- Brush size hints accessory scale  
- Make slightly larger than intended  
- Overlap is better than gaps

#### Description Quality

- Be specific and detailed  
- Include materials and colors  
- Describe positioning

#### Good Accessory Descriptions

- “Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in blue wool blanket”  
- “Large fiddle leaf fig in white ceramic planter with drainage tray”  
- “Stack of 5 hardcover books with neutral linen spines”

#### Avoid Vague Descriptions

- “Brown dog”  
- “Plant”  
- “Books”

## Photography Best Practices

### Lighting Setup

- Even lighting, minimize harsh shadows  
- Neutral color to avoid color casts  
- Shoot from multiple angles  
- Keep exposure consistent

### Product Preparation

- Clean thoroughly – dust and marks show  
- Steam or iron fabrics  
- Check alignment and symmetry  
- Stage naturally

### Technical Tips

#### Camera Settings
- Use a tripod
- ISO below 800
- Aperture around f/8
- Shoot in RAW if possible

#### Post-Processing
- Remove background if needed
- Adjust brightness/contrast
- Avoid heavy filters

#### File Handling
- Export high-res JPEG or PNG
- Keep original version
- Avoid recompression
