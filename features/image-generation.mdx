## Critical Canvas Placement Rules

### The Permanent Position Principle

> **CRITICAL:** Where you place the product on canvas is its **FINAL** position. This cannot be changed after generation.

#### Placement Steps

1. **Upload Product** – Import your silo or lifestyle shot  
2. **Position Carefully** – Place product where it should appear in final scene  
3. **Scale Appropriately** – Size tells AI about floor level and perspective  
4. **Leave Space** – Empty canvas space = room for AI to build scene

### Common Positioning Mistakes

| **Mistake**            | **Result**              | **Solution**                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Product fills canvas   | No room for scene       | Scale down, reposition        |
| Floating placement     | Unrealistic scenes      | Lower to establish floor      |
| Edge placement         | Cropped results         | Center with margin            |
| Wrong scale            | Proportion issues       | Reference real-world size     |

## Pre-Generation Workflow

### Accessorizing Before Generation

> **Rule:** Add ALL accessories **before** clicking “Generate background”

1. Position main product  
2. Select Accessorize tool  
3. Brush areas for each accessory  
4. Describe specifically what should appear  
5. Then generate complete scene

### Brush Tool Technique

#### Size Guidance

- Brush size hints accessory scale  
- Make slightly larger than intended  
- Overlap is better than gaps

#### Description Quality

- Be specific and detailed  
- Include materials and colors  
- Describe positioning

#### Good Accessory Descriptions

- “Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in blue wool blanket”  
- “Large fiddle leaf fig in white ceramic planter with drainage tray”  
- “Stack of 5 hardcover books with neutral linen spines”

#### Avoid Vague Descriptions

- “Brown dog”  
- “Plant”  
- “Books”
