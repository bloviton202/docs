### How it works

1. Select the **Magic Erase** tool
2. Paint over the object(s) you want to remove
3. AI automatically fills the area while preserving lighting and scene consistency

**Tip:** Paint slightly beyond object edges for better blending, and work on one object at a time for cleaner results.
