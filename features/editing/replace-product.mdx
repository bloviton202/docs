### When to use Replace Product

Use **Replace Product** when you want to:

- Test different product variants in the same scene
- Create consistent family shots
- Run A/B tests with different products
- Keep the same background, lighting, and shadows

---

### Important

The **new product image must be shot from the same angle and perspective** as the original.

Because the background and scene are not altered or rotated, matching angles ensures a natural, seamless integration.

---

### How it works

1. Select the **Replace Product** tool
2. Upload your new product image taken from the same angle as the original
3. AI swaps the product while preserving the rest of the scene â€” background, lighting, and shadows remain unchanged
