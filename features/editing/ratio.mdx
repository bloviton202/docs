### When to use Change Aspect Ratio

Use **Change Aspect Ratio** when you want to:

- Adapt images for social media, web banners, or print formats
- Repurpose an existing scene for multiple platforms
- Maintain your product placement while adjusting dimensions

---

### Available formats

- **Square (1:1)** â€” Instagram posts, thumbnails
- **Portrait (2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 9:16)** â€” Social media vertical formats
- **Landscape (3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 16:9)** â€” Websites, banners, videos

### How it works

AI extends or crops the scene to fit the new ratio while preserving your productâ€™s position and lighting.
