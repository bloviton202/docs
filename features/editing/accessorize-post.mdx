### When to use Accessorize After Generation

Use this feature to:

- Add simple accessories strictly **within the product's mask** (e.g., a cushion on a couch)

<Warning>
**Beta Feature Notice**

This feature is still in beta and not optimized for adding elements outside the product area. Accessories placed outside the product mask may be poorly integrated, with visible white outlines or glitches.

For accessories that should appear near but outside the product (e.g., a person sitting on the couch or an object on a coffee table in front), we recommend using **[Accessorize Before Generation](/features/pre-gen/accessorize-pre)** to ensure perfect integration with the background.
</Warning>

### How it works

1. Generate your background
2. Select the **Accessorize** tool
3. Use the **brush tool** to define the accessory's boundaries
   - The brush size hints at the accessory's scale
   
<Tip>
Brush slightly larger than the actual accessory for best results
</Tip>
4. Choose how to add your accessory (three options):
   - Provide a **detailed description**
   - Select an image from our catalog (used as a reference, not replicated exactly)
   - Upload an image from the internet or your catalog (also used as reference)
5. Generate the scene with the accessory included
