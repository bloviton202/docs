## When to Use Accessorize After Generation

<Card title="Add Simple Accessories" icon="plus-circle">
  Place accessories **strictly within the product's mask** (e.g., a cushion on a couch).
</Card>

<Warning>
  **Beta Feature Notice**
  This feature is still in beta and not optimized for adding elements **outside** the product area. Accessories placed outside the product mask may result in visible white outlines or glitches.

  <br />

  For accessories that should appear near but outside the product (e.g., a person sitting on the couch or an object on a coffee table), we recommend using [**Accessorize Before Generation**](/features/pre-gen/accessorize-pre) for perfect integration with the background.
</Warning>
