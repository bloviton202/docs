### When to use Magic Replace

Use **Magic Replace** when you want to:

- Change a material (e.g., wood → metal, fabric → leather)
- Adjust a color (e.g., beige → gray, oak → walnut)
- Update a style (e.g., modern → vintage, simple → ornate)

### How it works

1. Click the object you want to replace
2. Type a precise description of what should appear instead
3. AI swaps the element while keeping lighting, perspective, and context consistent

**Tip:** The AI preserves the original shape and placement — be specific in your replacement description for the best results.
