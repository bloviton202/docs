### When to Use This Feature

Use **Multi-Product** when you want to:

- Create bundle images for e-commerce or marketing
- Show product combinations in one unified scene
- Present complementary items together (e.g., chair \+ table)

---

### How It Works

1. **Upload Your Product Images**
   Add each item you want to include in the scene.
2. **Ensure Consistency**
   - All products **must** be photographed from the **same angle and perspective**
   - We don’t rotate or distort your images — matching angles ensures a natural, logical composition
3. **Generate Your Scene**
   Once added, all products become part of the same cutout and will be composed together when you generate the background.
