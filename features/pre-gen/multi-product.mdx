### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Product Images">
    Add each item you want to include in the scene.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure Consistency">
    - All products **must** be photographed from the **same angle and perspective**
    - We don't rotate or distort your images â€” matching angles ensures a natural, logical composition
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Your Scene">
    Once added, all products become part of the same cutout and will be composed together when you generate the background.
