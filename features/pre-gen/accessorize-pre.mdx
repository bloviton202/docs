## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Accessory Area">
    <Card title="Mark Boundaries" icon="brush">
      Use the **Brush Tool** to mark where the accessory should appear.
      - Brush size determines the intended object size.
      - Increase the margin around your product if you need to paint outside the product area.
    </Card>
    <Tip>
      Brush slightly **larger** than the actual accessory for better results.
