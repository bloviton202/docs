### When to Use This Feature
Use **Accessorize** when you want to:
- Enhance your product with complementary items
- Create lifestyle-oriented packshots with added context
- Add storytelling elements before the background is generated

---
### How It Works

1. **Define the Accessory Area**
   - Use the **Brush Tool** to mark the accessory's boundaries
   - Brush size determines the intended object size
   - If needed, **increase the margin around your product** before brushing to paint outside the product area
   
<Tip>
Brush slightly *larger* than the actual accessory for better results
</Tip>

2. **Choose How to Add Your Accessory**

   #### **Option 1: Detailed Description**
   - Be as specific as possible, especially for complex objects like animals or people
   
<Note>
**Examples:**
- Good: *"Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in a blue wool blanket"*
- Avoid: *"Brown dog"*
</Note>

   #### **Option 2: Select from Our Catalog**
   - Used as a visual reference, not replicated exactly

   #### **Option 3: Upload an Image**
   - From the internet or your own catalog (used as a visual reference, not replicated exactly)

3. **Add Accessories One by One**
   - Add an accessory, click **Save changes**, then add another if needed
   - Once saved, accessories become a **permanent** part of the final product cutout and cannot be edited later
