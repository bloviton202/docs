**Transform elements while preserving the scene composition.**

**How it works:**

3. AI seamlessly swaps the element while maintaining lighting and perspective  

**Common replacements:**

**How it works:**

1. Open the edit panel  
2. Select “Resize Product”  
3. Adjust the bounding box to reposition or rescale

### Change Aspect Ratio

**Switch between different canvas formats without regenerating.**

**Available formats:**

- Square (1:1) — Instagram posts, thumbnails  
- Portrait (2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 9:16) — Vertical formats for social  
- Landscape (3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 16:9) — Website, banners, videos

**How it works:**  
AI intelligently extends or crops the scene to fit the new ratio while preserving your product’s placement.

> 🧠 The AI fills new areas with context-aware content, maintaining consistent lighting and style.

### Relight

**Fine-tune lighting after generation for perfect ambiance.**

**Lighting options:**

- **Low** — Dim, moody lighting  
- **Medium** — Balanced daylight with soft shadows  
- **High** — Bright, clean lighting with minimal shadows  

**How it works:**  
Each option generates 4 variations. Select your favorite, or generate more until you’re satisfied.

> 🔆 **Medium** works best for e-commerce; **Low** creates ambiance; **High** is ideal for product showcases.

### Accessorize After Background Generation

**Add objects on top of your product after generating the background.**

**How it works:**

1. Generate your background  
2. Select the Accessorize tool  
3. Brush where the accessory should appear  
4. Describe the object precisely  
5. Generate scene with accessory included  

**Effective descriptions:**

✅ “Potted monstera plant in white ceramic planter”  
✅ “Stack of hardcover books with neutral spines”  
✅ “Geometric gold table lamp with white shade”  
❌ “Plant” (too vague)  
❌ “Books” (lacks detail)

> 🖌️ Brush size hints at the accessory scale. Make the area slightly larger than needed.  
> ⚠️ **Beta Tip:** This feature is still in beta. For best results, only add accessories that stay within the product's mask (e.g., a pillow on a couch), to avoid white outlines or rendering glitches.

### Replace Product

**Swap your main product while keeping the generated scene.**

**How it works:**

1. Select the Replace Product tool  
2. Upload a new product image  
3. AI swaps the product while maintaining the same scene, lighting, and shadows  

**Perfect for:**

- Testing product variants  
- Creating family shots  
- A/B testing  
- Maintaining scene consistency
