### 3. **Accessorize Your Product**

Add accessories around your product to enhance your composition.  
These will become part of your packshot once you click ‚ÄúSave changes.‚Äù

**How to add accessories:**

- Use the brush tool to define where you want the accessory ‚Äì the brush size tells the AI how big to make the item  
- Make the brushing slightly larger than the desired item size  
- Be specific in your descriptions for better results:
  - Instead of: `Brown dog`
  - Try: `Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in a blue wool blanket`

**Tip**: build up accessories gradually ‚Äì add one, save your image, then add another.
