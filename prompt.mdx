mode: "wide"

## Introduction

Prompting for product visualization requires distinct approaches depending on the product type and its intended environment. This comprehensive guide breaks down best practices for three main categories:

1. **General Furniture** - Easy to stage as the focal point
2. **Accessories & Wall/Ceiling-Mounted Products** - Require precise placement techniques
3. **Professional Staging** - Complex environments like restaurants, offices, or classrooms

Each section includes actionable tips, example prompts, and recommended scenes to achieve realistic, high-quality results that convert.
