## Why Quality Matters

Great product photos are the foundation for stunning AI-generated scenes. The better your images, the better the final result. Invest in good photography for top-quality visuals\!

---

## Accepted File Formats

- Supported formats: **.jpg, .png, .webp** (all common image types)
- Transparency: **PNG with alpha channel** is ideal for precise cutouts
- Max file size: up to **50MB per image**

---

## Resolution Recommendations

**Always upload your highest-resolution photos.** AI can’t add details that aren’t there.

| Minimum                     | Recommended                     | Optimal                       |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| 1000×1000 px (web use only) | 2000×2000 px (standard quality) | 4000×4000 px\+ (print & zoom) |

## Background Options

### White Background (Silo)

- Clean, consistent, and professional look
- Perfect for e-commerce, catalogs, and batch processing
- Make sure the white is pure (#FFFFFF), not grayish

### Lifestyle Shots

- Product shown in a natural room or scene
- AI automatically removes background
- Use when silo shots aren’t available

_Background removal is automatic for both — no manual masking needed\!_

## 3D Rendering Tips

- Export at high resolution: minimum 2K (2048×2048), recommended 4K (4096×4096), ideal 8K if possible
