## ✂️ Edit Cut-out

Edit the cut-out of your product to fix imperfections or refine its outline before generation.

## 🪑 Multi-product

Add multiple products into the scene to generate visuals combining different packshots.

## 📐 Aspect Ratio

Choose the format of your final image (1:1, 4:5, 16:9, etc.).

👉 **Tip**: You can change the aspect ratio anytime without regenerating the whole scene\!

## 🎨 Accessorize

Add accessories around your product (e.g., cushions, plants, people) before generating the background to enrich your scene.

## ⚖️ Framing best practices

- Place your product **large enough within the frame**, ideally covering about **two-thirds of the initial image size**.
- This ensures better definition of the product and prevents dimension or proportion issues during background generation.
