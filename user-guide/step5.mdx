## Printing Tips: Understanding DPI (Dots Per Inch)

<Info>
  **Quick DPI Guide:**

  - **300 DPI:** Professional print quality
  - **150 DPI:** Good quality for larger prints
  - **72-100 DPI:** Digital displays only

  When printing, both image resolution and DPI determine print quality. Higher DPI means sharper print, but requires higher resolution images.
