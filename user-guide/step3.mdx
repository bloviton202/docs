## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Product">
    Start with any product photo — a silo shot or an existing lifestyle image. Our AI automatically removes the background for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position & Scale">
    Place and resize your product on the canvas. This defines the floor plane and composition. Leave enough space around your product to let the AI build the scene naturally.

      style={{ width:"100%",maxWidth:"600px",borderRadius:"8px",marginTop:"16px",marginBottom:"16px",border:"1px solid #e5e7eb" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Scene & Generate">
    Use text prompts or the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired environment. AI then creates a photorealistic scene in seconds, with correct lighting, shadows, and perspective.

## **The Art of Prompting: A Guide by Product Type and Scene**

Prompting for product visualization requires distinct approaches depending on the product type and its intended environment. This guide breaks down best practices for three categories:

1. **General Furniture** (easy to stage as the focal point).
2. **Accessories & Wall/Ceiling-Mounted Products** (require precise placement).
3. **Professional Staging** (complex environments like restaurants, offices, or classrooms).

Each section includes **prompt structure frameworks**, **example prompts**, and **recommended scenes** to achieve realistic, high-quality results.

---

## 1. General Furniture Prompting

Showcase the product as the main subject with two distinct approaches:

- **Brand-Guideline Prompts** for rich, immersive scenes
- **Minimalist Prompts** for clean, product-focused visuals

    #### Step-by-Step Construction

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Define Focal Object & Setting">
        **Example:** "_Chaise lounge in a moody traditional reading corner_"

        <Tip>
          Specify the room's purpose and dominant style for better context
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Describe Architectural Features">
        **Example:** "_Position the chaise lounge near Tudor-style windows with black diamond-pattern leaded glass mullions and matching trim.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Add Furniture & Accessories">
        **Example:** "_Beside the chaise, place a cylindrical side table in white marble with dramatic black veining, topped with a light wood bowl. Add a brass perforated floor lamp, its arch hovering over the chaise. A neutral-toned wool rug peeks out from under the chaise._"

      <Step title="Specify Textiles & Materials">
        **Example:** "_Frame the windows with floor-to-ceiling taupe linen drapes hung from a black metal rod, pooling elegantly on the floor. A plush gray wool rug is partially visible beneath the chaise._"

      <Step title="Integrate the Exterior Context">
        **Example:** "_Beyond the windows, a lush green landscape stretches out, bathed in the golden light of late afternoon. The sky transitions from deep blue to soft peach near the horizon, with a few wispy clouds._"

Design upper cabinets in soft gray with glass-front doors displaying white dishware, flanking a concealed range hood. Install lower cabinets in deep charcoal blue. Create a full-height marble slab backsplash matching the countertops. Above the island, suspend two clear glass pendant lights with tiered, vintage-inspired designs and brass hardware on black cords. Include a brass pot filler faucet above the range and matching brass kitchen faucet at the sink. Style the island with a white ceramic vase containing burgundy and green foliage, fresh lemons in a navy bowl, white serving pieces, and cookbooks.

Natural light should illuminate the space, highlighting the contrast between the light upper cabinets and dark lower cabinets. The overall aesthetic should be transitional elegance, mixing traditional elements like subway tile with contemporary two-tone cabinetry and luxurious marble surfaces.

The sky should be bright clear blue indicating midday sun. Natural sunlight should create defined shadows under the daybed and patio cover.

              Vase in a cozy built-in breakfast nook positioned prominently on a round natural wood pedestal table with a fluted or ridged cylindrical base. Set the scene within warm oak built-in shelving with a deep sage green painted back wall. Behind the vase, create an L-shaped banquette with cushions upholstered in a green and cream checkered or geometric pattern. Above the seating area, arrange a small gallery wall with 2-3 framed artworks in natural tones. Include a woven rattan dining chair with natural wood frame positioned at the table, featuring an intricate basketweave pattern in the seat and back. The shelving should be styled minimally with ceramic vessels, a few books, and pottery pieces in neutral tones. Natural light should stream in from the left, creating dramatic shadows and highlighting the vase's textured surface and metallic finish. The floor should be light wood or neutral tile with a textured natural fiber rug visible in the corner. The overall atmosphere should be warm, sophisticated, and inviting, with the sculptural vase commanding attention as the focal point of this intimate dining space, zoomed out to see more of the built-in

        Modern urban café or restaurant interior, viewed from the entrance toward the back seating area. The space features a harmonious blend of contemporary and minimalist design elements. In the foreground, place a series of light gray banquette seating along the left wall, paired with small marble-topped tables and black metal legs. Each table is set with simple white ceramic plates, linen napkins, and a small vase holding delicate white flowers. The banquette is upholstered in a soft, light gray fabric, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. In the background, position my restaurant table as part of the main dining area. The table should have a sleek marble top with subtle gray veining, supported by a black metal frame. Surround it with four modern dining chairs, upholstered in dark gray fabric with thin, gold-toned metal legs. The table is set with minimalist white tableware, polished silver cutlery, and clear glass drinkware, ready to welcome guests. The walls are adorned with vertical dark green panels, adding depth and a touch of elegance to the space. Suspended above the tables are white pendant lights with a retro-inspired design, casting a warm and inviting glow. The ceiling features a grid of black slatted panels, adding a geometric contrast to the room. The floor is covered in light wood planks, complementing the overall modern aesthetic. Large windows on the right side of the image let in ample natural light, softened by horizontal blinds. Outside the windows, a hint of greenery is visible, adding a refreshing touch to the urban setting. The overall atmosphere is one of modern sophistication, with a balance of warm and cool tones, creating a welcoming environment for diners.
