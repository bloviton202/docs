## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Product">
    Start with any product photo â€” a silo shot or an existing lifestyle image. Our AI automatically removes the background for you.

    <Card title="Accepted Formats" icon="upload">
      - Product photos (any format)
      - Silo shots or lifestyle images
      - Automatic background removal
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position & Scale">
    Place and resize your product on the canvas. This defines the floor plane and composition. Leave enough space around your product to let the AI build the scene naturally.

    <img
      src="/images/canvas-positioning.png"
      alt="Canvas positioning interface showing product placement"
      style={{ width:"100%",maxWidth:"600px",borderRadius:"8px",marginTop:"16px",marginBottom:"16px",border:"1px solid #e5e7eb" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Scene & Generate">
    Use text prompts or the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired environment. AI then creates a photorealistic scene in seconds, with correct lighting, shadows, and perspective.
  </Step>
