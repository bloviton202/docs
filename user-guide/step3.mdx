## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Product">
    Start with any product photo — a silo shot or an existing lifestyle image. Our AI automatically removes the background for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position & Scale">
    Place and resize your product on the canvas. This defines the floor plane and composition. Leave enough space around your product to let the AI build the scene naturally.

      style={{ width:"100%",maxWidth:"600px",borderRadius:"8px",marginTop:"16px",marginBottom:"16px",border:"1px solid #e5e7eb" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Scene & Generate">
    Use text prompts or the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired environment. AI then creates a photorealistic scene in seconds, with correct lighting, shadows, and perspective.

## **The Art of Prompting: A Guide by Product Type and Scene**

Prompting for product visualization requires distinct approaches depending on the product type and its intended environment. This guide breaks down best practices for three categories:

1. **General Furniture** (easy to stage as the focal point).
2. **Accessories & Wall/Ceiling-Mounted Products** (require precise placement).
3. **Professional Staging** (complex environments like restaurants, offices, or classrooms).

Each section includes **tips**, **example prompts**, and **recommended scenes** to achieve realistic, high-quality results.

---

## 1. General Furniture Prompting

Showcase the product as the main subject with two distinct approaches:

- **Brand-Guideline Prompts** for rich, immersive scenes
- **Minimalist Prompts** for clean, product-focused visuals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Brand-Guideline Prompts">
    ### Rich, Immersive Scenes

    Create stylized environments perfectly aligned with brand guidelines, focusing on ambiance, materials, and architectural context.

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Architectural & Design Details" icon="building">

        </ul>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Furniture & Decor" icon="couch">
        <ul>
        Primary Furniture: Shape, material, color (e.g., velvet chaise, walnut island).

        </ul>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    #### Step-by-Step Construction

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Define Focal Object & Setting">
        **Example:** "_Chaise lounge in a moody traditional reading corner_"

        <Tip>
          Specify the room's purpose and dominant style for better context
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Describe Architectural Features">
        **Example:** "_Position the chaise lounge near Tudor-style windows with black diamond-pattern leaded glass mullions and matching trim. The walls are painted in warm mushroom gray, and the floor is light oak in a herringbone pattern. The ceiling, 3 meters high, features exposed dark oak beams._"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add Furniture & Accessories">
        **Example:** "_Beside the chaise, place a cylindrical side table in white marble with dramatic black veining, topped with a light wood bowl. Add a brass perforated floor lamp, its arch hovering over the chaise. A neutral-toned wool rug peeks out from under the chaise._"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Specify Textiles & Materials">
        **Example:** "_Frame the windows with floor-to-ceiling taupe linen drapes hung from a black metal rod, pooling elegantly on the floor. A plush gray wool rug is partially visible beneath the chaise._"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Detail the Lighting">
        **Example:** "_Natural light filters through the diamond-paned windows, casting geometric shadows on the walls. A brass pendant light above the island casts a warm glow on the marble countertop._"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Integrate the Exterior Context">
        **Example:** "_Beyond the windows, a lush green landscape stretches out, bathed in the golden light of late afternoon. The sky transitions from deep blue to soft peach near the horizon, with a few wispy clouds._"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Define Atmosphere">
        **Example:** "_The overall atmosphere is sophisticated and contemplative, perfect for an English-inspired library where traditional architecture meets luxurious comfort in a palette of warm grays and natural tones._"

Each table is set with simple white ceramic plates, linen napkins, and a small vase holding delicate white flowers. The banquette is upholstered in a soft, light gray fabric, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. In the background, position my restaurant table as part of the main dining area. The table should have a sleek marble top with subtle gray veining, supported by a black metal frame. Surround it with four modern dining chairs, upholstered in dark gray fabric with thin, gold-toned metal legs. The table is set with minimalist white tableware, polished silver cutlery, and clear glass drinkware, ready to welcome guests. The walls are adorned with vertical dark green panels, adding depth and a touch of elegance to the space. Suspended above the tables are white pendant lights with a retro-inspired design, casting a warm and inviting glow. The ceiling features a grid of black slatted panels, adding a geometric contrast to the room. The floor is covered in light wood planks, complementing the overall modern aesthetic. Large windows on the right side of the image let in ample natural light, softened by horizontal blinds. Outside the windows, a hint of greenery is visible, adding a refreshing touch to the urban setting.
