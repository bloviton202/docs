## **How It Works**

**1. Upload Your Product**

Start with any product photo — a silo shot or an existing lifestyle image. Our AI automatically removes the background for you.

**2. Position & Scale**

Place and resize your product on the canvas. This defines the floor plane and composition. Leave enough space around your product to let the AI build the scene naturally.

**3. Describe Your Scene & Generate**

Use text prompts or the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired environment. AI then creates a photorealistic scene in seconds, with correct lighting, shadows, and perspective.

- “Scandinavian office space with natural wood”

### Assisted Prompt

- Enter a simple idea
- AI expands it to 30\+ detailed keywords
- Ensures optimal scene layout and realism
- Improves quality and detail

### Inspiration Images

Upload reference images to guide the style:

1. AI analyzes visual features
2. Converts to descriptive text prompt
3. Editable before generation
4. No copyright risk — only extracts style

How to write prompts for great photorealistic images

---

## **Why Good Prompts Matter**

Great AI images come from clear prompts that guide the AI but still leave room for creativity.

**Main idea:** Be clear about what you want, but let the AI handle the artistic details.

---

## **Using the Assisted Prompt Tool**

This tool helps you turn a simple idea into a detailed prompt automatically:

- Expands your idea into 30\+ keywords
- Adds photography terms
- Keeps the scene consistent
- Works especially well for furniture

**How to use it:**

1. Type a simple idea (e.g., “modern living room”)
2. The AI adds details like lighting, materials, and mood
3. You can review and tweak the prompt
4. Generate your scene

---

## **Two Ways to Prompt**

### 1. Write a Description

Just describe what you want in normal language:

- Room style and type
- Atmosphere and lighting
- Key furniture or features
- The AI fills in the rest

### 2. Upload Inspiration Images

Upload photos for the AI to analyze style and colors.

No copyright worries — the AI only extracts style ideas, not copies images.

---

## **How to Edit Prompts**

Use chat commands or edit the prompt directly:

- Add elements (“Add a large window with curtains”)
- Remove elements (“Remove the fireplace”)
- Change style (“Make it industrial with exposed brick”)
- Adjust mood (“Warmer lighting, sunset glow”)

---

## **What Makes a Good Prompt?**

Include:

1. Room type and style (“Modern minimalist bedroom”)
2. Product placement (“Sofa against back wall”)
3. Lighting and mood (“Soft morning light”)
4. Key details (“Wooden coffee table, plants”)

**Formula:**

`[Style] [Room Type] with [Product Placement], [Lighting], [Mood], [Key Elements], [Extras]`

Example:

“Modern farmhouse living room with gray sofa against shiplap wall, warm afternoon light, cozy atmosphere, wooden coffee table, woven rug, potted plants”

---

## **Be Specific**

| What to specify | Weak            | Strong                                     |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Style           | “nice room”     | “mid-century modern living room”           |
| Placement       | “sofa in room”  | “sofa against north wall facing fireplace” |
| Lighting        | “good lighting” | “soft natural light from large windows”    |
| Mood            | “comfortable”   | “warm, inviting with hygge elements”       |

Avoid overly technical or conflicting details.
