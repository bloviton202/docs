---

### 1. Start with High-Quality Product Images

- Use clean, well-lit packshots with neutral backgrounds.
- Ensure your product is fully visible and centered.
- Avoid overly cropped or low-resolution images.

---

### 2. Write Clear, Descriptive Prompts

- Be specific about the scene, style, ambiance, and props you want.
- Include material, lighting, and setting details when relevant.
- Example: “Scandinavian living room with light wood floors and large bay windows, soft morning light” is better than “modern room.”

---

### 3. Choose the Right Generation Mode

- **Single Generation**: For unique, creative or high-control scenes.
- **Batch Mode**: For fast, consistent visuals across multiple products.
- **Video Mode**: To bring your renders to life with subtle motion.
- **[Pre-Generation Accessorize](/features/pre-gen/accessorize-pre)**: Add items that become part of your packshot.
- **[Post-Generation Accessorize](/features/editing/accessorize-post)** (beta): Use only for objects fully inside the product mask (e.g. pillows on sofas).

---

### 4. Clean & Refine with Editing Tools

- Use **[Magic Erase](/features/editing/erase)** to remove distractions or unwanted items.
- Use **[Magic Replace](/features/editing/magic-replace)** to adjust materials or colors.
- Use **[Resize Product](/features/editing/resize)** to reposition or rescale your product.
- Use **[Relight](/features/editing/relight)** to explore different lighting moods before downloading.

---

### 5. Test Before Scaling

- Start with small test batches before launching a full catalog update.
- Validate prompt consistency and generation quality.

---

### 6. Match Format to Use Case

- **1:1** for Instagram and thumbnails
- **3:4 / 4:5** for social media posts
- **16:9** for banners and websites
- Select aspect ratio before generation or adjust later via the editor.

---

### 7. Save Versions and Organize Your Work

- Use albums to keep track of edits and versions.
- Save intermediate steps so you can go back or compare results.

---

### 8. Build Prompt Templates

- Create reusable prompt templates by style, collection, or campaign.
- Standardize descriptions for better brand consistency and faster production.

---

### 9. Combine Tools for Best Results

- [Accessorize](/features/pre-gen/accessorize-pre) → Generate → Edit → Download.
- Don’t rely on a single tool – stack features for refined outputs.

---

### 10. Avoid Common Pitfalls

- Avoid vague prompts (e.g. “nice room”, “lamp”, “plants”).
- Don’t add accessories that stick out beyond the product’s cutout in post-generation.
- Don’t skip the brush sizing step – brush size = item scale.
