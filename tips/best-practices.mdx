## 1. Upload High-Quality Product

<Card title="Why Quality Matters" icon="camera">
  Great product photos are the foundation for stunning AI-generated scenes. The quality of the final image is directly dependent on the quality of the uploaded product shot.
</Card>

## 2. Accessorize the Product

<Card title="Objective" icon="tools">
  Create a believable and immersive context.
</Card>

**Examples by scene:**
-   **Office:** Add a laptop, notebooks, or a coffee mug.
-   **Restaurant:** Include cutlery, plates, or a tablecloth.
-   **School:** Integrate books, a blackboard, or chairs.

**Tip:** Accessories must be consistent with the product's use and the scene.

## 3. Logical Placement in the Initial Frame

<Card title="Golden Rule" icon="expand">
  Adapt the product's size to the image's intention.
</Card>

**Placement Options:**
-   **Product Zoom:** The product should take up a large part of the frame.
-   **Wide Context:** The product can be smaller, but it should still be visible and highlighted.

## 4. Prompt Adapted to the Product and Scene

<Card title="Prompt Examples" icon="pencil-ruler">
  - **Sofa:** "A navy blue velvet sofa, placed against a white wall, with a decorative cushion and a light wood coffee table next to it. Natural light coming from a window on the left."
  - **Wall Lamp:** "Black metal wall lamp, fixed 1.80m from the floor, lighting a bare brick wall. No elements behind the lamp."
</Card>

**Avoid:**
-   Illogical elements (e.g., a sofa with objects behind it if the wall is supposed to be bare).
-   Overly broad descriptions if the product is in a close-up.
